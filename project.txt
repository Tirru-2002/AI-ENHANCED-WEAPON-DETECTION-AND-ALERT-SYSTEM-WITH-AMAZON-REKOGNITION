Here’s how you can describe the AI-Enhanced Weapon Detection and Alert System project in your resume, including its use cases, tools, technologies, methods, and challenges:

Project Title:
AI-Enhanced Weapon Detection and Alert System with Amazon Rekognition

Description:
Developed a Django-based web application that integrates Amazon Rekognition to detect weapons in images and videos. The system provides real-time analysis, user authentication, and a dashboard for managing and viewing results. This project is designed to enhance security by identifying potential threats in public spaces or restricted areas.

Use Cases:
Public Safety: Detect weapons in surveillance footage to prevent incidents in public spaces like malls, airports, and schools.
Law Enforcement: Assist police and security agencies in analyzing evidence for weapon detection.
Restricted Area Monitoring: Monitor sensitive areas for unauthorized weapons.
Event Security: Analyze live feeds or uploaded media for potential threats during large gatherings.
Tools and Technologies:
Backend:
Django: For building the web application and managing user authentication.
MySQL: For storing user data, analysis results, and application metadata.
AI and Machine Learning:
Amazon Rekognition: For object detection and analysis in images and videos.
Boto3: AWS SDK for Python to interact with Rekognition and S3.
Frontend:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: For creating user-friendly interfaces.
Bootstrap: For responsive design.
Image Processing:
Pillow (PIL): For drawing bounding boxes and annotations on detected objects.
Cloud Services:
AWS S3: For storing uploaded videos.
AWS SNS: For notifications during video analysis.
Development Environment:
Python Virtual Environment: For dependency management.
VS Code: As the primary IDE.
Methods Used:
Object Detection:
Used Amazon Rekognition to detect objects like firearms, blades, and other weapons in images and videos.
Filtered results to focus on weapon-related labels.
Image and Video Analysis:
Uploaded videos to AWS S3 and used Rekognition’s asynchronous video analysis for label detection.
Processed images locally and annotated detected objects using Pillow.
User Management:
Implemented user registration, login, and profile management using Django’s authentication system.
Result Visualization:
Displayed analysis results (labels, confidence scores) on a user dashboard with annotated images/videos.
Error Handling:
Added robust error handling for invalid inputs and AWS service failures.
Challenges and Solutions:
1. Challenge: Handling Large Video Files
Problem: Uploading and analyzing large video files could lead to performance bottlenecks.
Solution: Used AWS S3 for efficient storage and Amazon Rekognition’s asynchronous video analysis to process videos in the background.
2. Challenge: Filtering Relevant Labels
Problem: Rekognition returns a wide range of labels, making it difficult to focus on weapon-related objects.
Solution: Filtered labels based on predefined categories (e.g., "Firearm", "Blade") to ensure accuracy.
3. Challenge: Annotating Images with Detected Objects
Problem: Annotating images with bounding boxes required precise image processing.
Solution: Used Pillow to draw bounding boxes and labels on the detected objects.
4. Challenge: Ensuring Real-Time Performance
Problem: Real-time analysis of images and videos was critical for usability.
Solution: Optimized the workflow by processing images locally and using asynchronous methods for video analysis.
5. Challenge: Managing AWS Credentials Securely
Problem: Storing AWS credentials securely was essential to prevent unauthorized access.
Solution: Used environment variables and Django’s settings.py to manage sensitive information.
Key Achievements:
Successfully integrated Amazon Rekognition for real-time weapon detection.
Designed a user-friendly dashboard for managing and visualizing analysis results.
Implemented robust error handling and optimized workflows for large media files.
Enhanced security by detecting potential threats in uploaded media.
